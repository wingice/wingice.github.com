Having enough Quality backlinks is very important for SEO. But how do you assess the qualities of your backlinks?

Verify all the backlinks manually is very time-consuming and boring.

If you have the same issue with me, I recommend a deep backlink checker, which will analyze all the LEVEL 1
and LEVEL 2 backlinks based on a lists of urls, and give you a complete report on the qualities of those backlinks.
