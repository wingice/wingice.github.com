A well organized Recruitment Management System can be very handy to improve the efficiency of hiring. These systems, such as [TalentLists](https://www.talentlists.com), provide recruiters various helpful features like sourcing and screening, interview scheduling, and applicant tracking. They also help you build talent pools where the passive candidates can be tracked, nurtured, and later sourced for 
job position.

Sometimes you need also a place to keep your personal candidates in a private talent pool. These candidates are only visible to you, no one else. They are probably people who don't want to be disturbed by anyone else except you. If you put them to a shared/public talent pool, other recruiters who don't know the background would irritate these candidates by occasionally checking and querying.

The Recruitment Management System also lets users manage private candidates, private resumes, and private job openings, in addition to shared/public candidates, resumes, and job openings. The shared/public job openings/candidates/resumes provide a great place for collaboration among recruiters, hiring managers, and interviewers. The private ones keep everything under your control, you can change them to public once appropriate. The system provides the flexibility of choice.
