There are two types of recruiting pipeline reports, each for a specific purpose.

Historical hiring pipeline report
=================================

Do you want to know how many applicants, how many candidates, how many interviews conducted, how many candidates passing the first round of interviews, how many offer letter sent, for an job opening?

The overall hiring pipeline report gives you those kinds of answers. This report summarizes all applications youâ€™ve received for an opening and the flow of candidate applications through the hiring process.

Daily hiring pipeline report and breakdown
==========================================

The freshness is very important for recruitment advertisements on the internet. The fresh recruitment AD will receive more candidates' attention and have more applications. So our system provides a daily hiring pipeline report to which provides the trending data of recruitment activities, including the numbers of "new applicant", "new candidate" and "interviewed candidates".
