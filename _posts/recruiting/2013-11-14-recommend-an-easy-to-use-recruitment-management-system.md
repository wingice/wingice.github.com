Recently I had to do a lot of recruiting jobs, I found it was very hard to recruit the qualified
talent which I needed. There were two main reasons:

* Have no central place to oversee all the recruiting activities
In my company, several job positions are open for candidates. Everyone is busy on interviewing, hiring.
But we can't get the progresses on these recruitment activities. Such as
<pre>
"Senior Project Manager", Planned to hire 10, 3 hired,  20 are waiting for interview.
"SAP Consultant"          Planned to hire 3   3 hired.  The opening of position should be closed.
.......
</pre>

* Can't find the qualified candidates
Nowadays the online recruiting is popular, everyone can send resumes to any position just with click of finger. You need a lot of time to screen, read and make interview appointments. On the other side of the coin, the qualified candidates won't submit their resumes to your posted job openings, if your company is not big or famous. So how can you do? 

* Recruitment process is too lengthy
Technical interview, Manager interview, and finally HR compensation package negotiation and confirm. No one was completely clear about the latest status, everyone was involved, but recruiting was still a little in chaos.

We tried an [Online Recruitment Management System](http://www.talentlists.com), and found it is quite simple to use.
And most important, it gives us a integrated dashboard to oversee all the recruiting goals and progresses.

It is simple, light-weight, and just finish what I want. Keep tracking of really talented people
in my industry and coordinate the recruitment process.

If you like it too, please leave a comment let me know. :-)
