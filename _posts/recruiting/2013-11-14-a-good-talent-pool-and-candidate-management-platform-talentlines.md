Recently I had to do a lot of recruiting jobs, I found it was very hard to recruit the qualified
talent which I needed. There were two main reasons:

* Can't find the qualified candidates
Nowadays the online recruiting is popular, everyone can send his resume to any company just with click of finger. If your company is not big or famous, the qualified candidates won't submit their resumes to your posted job openings.

* Recruitment process is too lengthy
Technical interview, Manager interview, and finally HR compensation package negotiation and confirm. No one was completely clear about the latest status, everyone was involved, but recruiting was still a little in chaos.

So [A Good online talent pool and candidate management solution](http://www.talentlines.com) become my choice after several days of investigation.

It is simple, light-weight, and just finish what I want. Keep tracking of really talented people
in my industry and coordinate the recruitment process.
